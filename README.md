## Details
→ The website provides interactive visualizations for various data structures, including linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.

→ The website uses python to implement the data structures, and flask to visualize it in HTML. 

→ Users can dynamically create, modify, and delete data structures through the website's intuitive user interface.

→ The website have a friendly user interface for computer science begainers who are welling to learn data Srtucture.

→ The website incorporates responsive design principles, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices and screen sizes.

→ An algorithm visualization feature is available, allowing users to step through different algorithms and observe their execution in real-time.

→ The website offers educational resources, including explanations and examples, to help users understand the concepts behind data structures and algorithms.

→ Using flash, the website send messages and print it to the screen

→ Comprehensive error handling is implemented to provide informative feedback to users in case of invalid inputs or operations.

→ The codebase follows best practices, including modularization, code commenting, and adherence to the Python style guide (PEP 8) for maintainability and readability.



          
## Binary Search tree

https://github.com/AndrewidRizk/DataSrtucture/assets/97995173/4edca33b-1d3b-4c01-856c-a2f67058c46c

→ `add(data)`: Adds a new node with the given data to the BST.

→ `remove(data)`: Removes a node with the given data from the BST.

→ `searchNode(data)`: Searches for a node with the given data in the BST and returns the node value if found.

→ `inorder_traverse()`: Performs an inorder traversal of the BST and stores the result in the inorder_result list.

→ `preorder_traverse()`: Performs a preorder traversal of the BST and stores the result in the preorder_result list.


## Max Heap Binary Tree

https://github.com/AndrewidRizk/DataSrtucture/assets/97995173/3074cf64-d47b-4016-9dee-961b7eb6f742

→ `insert(value)`: Inserts a new value into the Max Heap.

→ `delete(value)`: Deletes a value from the Max Heap.

→ `make_binary_tree()`: Creates a binary tree representation of the Max Heap.

→ `find_left_child_element(element)`: Returns the left child index of the given element.

→ `find_right_child_element(element)`: Returns the right child index of the given element.


## Min Heap Binary Tree


https://github.com/AndrewidRizk/DataSrtucture/assets/97995173/7d4f8bd6-0705-4da9-aafa-f9f1eaec4764

→ `insert(value)`: Inserts a new value into the Min Heap.

→ `delete(value)`: Deletes a value from the Min Heap.

→ `make_binary_tree()`: Creates a binary tree representation of the Min Heap.

→ `find_left_child_element(element)`: Returns the left child index of the given element.

→ `find_right_child_element(element)`: Returns the right child index of the given element.


## Linked Lists

https://github.com/AndrewidRizk/DataSrtucture/assets/97995173/f1c1e08b-9aca-48b5-bd9a-965740c2b1ef

→ `insert_at_beginning(data)`: Inserts a new node with the given data at the beginning of the linked list.

→ `insert_at_end(data)`: Inserts a new node with the given data at the end of the linked list.

→ `insert_after_node(prev_node2, data)`: Inserts a new node with the given data after a specified previous node.

→ `delete_node(data)`: Deletes a node with the given data from the linked list.

→ `search(data)`: Searches for a node with the given data in the linked list and returns a linked list of steps.
