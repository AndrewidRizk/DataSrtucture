## Details
→ The website uses python to implement the data structures, and flask to visualize it in HTML. 

→ The website have a friendly user interface for computer science begainers who are welling to learn data Srtucture.

→ Some jinja.js was used in the HTML pages to correctly visualize the placement of the nodes on the tree.

→ Using flash I was able to send messages and print it to the screen
